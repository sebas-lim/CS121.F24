# Part 1 : To be done before you start your project

** In future activities, the `PLAN.md` document is where you will do
   your pre-coding thinking and planning. For this activity, you will
   only fill in the *Reflection* section.  The other sections are
   filled in as examples of how to fill them out later. **


## Program Overview

1. In your own words, explain the purpose of this program in at most
   three sentences.  (What does it do? What input will it need? What
   output does it produce?)

   This program produces an ASCII art image.

   I think the purpose of this program is to start getting familiar with all the correct writing, variables, etc. we need to write when writing code. 
   

2. List each source file in the project and explain its purpose.  You
   don't have to use complete sentences.

   * ModernArt.java - driver class (class that contains main); prints the art

## Program Planning

Choose one part of the program and write an algorithm to solve that
part.  Your algorithm should be in the form of comments that you can
copy/paste into your source file after you're done.  The piece can be
for a specific method (other than getters, setters, toString, or
constructors), the main method, or a significant chunk of the main
method.

// Prints a dog face

// Print the ears

// Print the top of the head

// Print the eyes

// Print the nose and tongue

// Print the bottom of the face


# Part 2: To be done after your program is done

## Reflection

1. Discuss one bug you encountered while programming.  How did you
   find the bug?  What process did you use to fix the bug?  What did
   you learn from this bug that might help you in the future?

I missed a ";" when I run my code. I think now I'll forget less times about writing it at the end. 


2. What, if anything, are you going to do differently on the next
   assignment?  (Consider things like: What other sources did you
   need?  Did you spend too much time debugging that could have been
   avoided by planning? How early/late did you start the project too
   late? How often did you go to the Kount Learning Center to get
   help? What processes did you use that were useful that you intend
   to use in the future?)



3. Was the algorithm you wrote in Part 1 correct? If not, write the
   corrected algorithm here.

   The algorithm given was correct, but yours should have been different!



I like a lot that I'm finally starting to learn something about programming. It's a bit complicated because I don't know a lot of things but I'm really enjoying it.
