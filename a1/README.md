# Module 1 Activity 1- Hello, Class!

## Purpose & Concepts
The purpose of this activity is to write, compile, and run your first program in Java using Visual Studio Code, an IDE.

## Problem Description
Enter, compile and run the following application.  
```
    public class HelloClass
    {  
        public static void main(String[] args)
        {
            System.out.println("Hello, Class!");
        }
    }  
```

## To Do
1. Expand the folder named a1 and create a new file named `HelloClass.java`
2. Enter the program code from the Problem Description
3. Run the program using the embedded links above the main method

## Review and Reflect
Reflection: At the end of PLAN.md write a one paragraph reflection describing your experience with this activity and the first day of class. What were your expectations coming into class? What went well? What was challenging? How have your expectations for the semester changed or stayed the same? What is something you are hoping to learn in this class? What is something you are worried about in this class?

## Finally
1. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that Activity 1.1 is complete.
2. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.

# Module 1 Activity 2 - Modern Art
![Activity1.2 Banner](images/modernArtPic.png)

## Purpose & Concepts
The purpose of this activity is to practice using the following concepts: String literal, println() and print() methods, Concatenation, Escape sequences, Variables, Assignment operator (=), camelCase, Constant.

## Problem Description
In this activity, you will create a Java program that uses println, print, string concatenation, variables, constants, and escape sequences to create your own ASCII art masterpiece. You can look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) to get some ideas.


## Requirements
Create a class called ModernArt.java that prints your masterpiece to the console. You must use:
   1. at least one `println()` statement
   1. at least one `print()` statement
   1. at least one instance of string concatenation
   1. at least one variable (e.g. store your name in a variable and print it somewhere in your artwork)
   1. at least one constant (e.g. use a string constant called `BORDER` to store a sequence of characters you are using as a border around your art)

## Before You Begin: Computational Thinking and Planning
1. Open `PLAN.md`.  In this document you will create a plan for your masterpiece *before* you begin coding. 

## To Do
1. Expand the folder named `a1` and create a new file named `ModernArt.java`
1. Using the steps you created in PLAN.md, create ModernArt.java to print your masterpiece using each of the required elements.

## Review and Reflect
1. Terminology Identification: In your code add comments identifying examples of the following: string literal, concatenation, escape sequence, variable, camelCase, constant. These should be identified with an @keyterm tag within the comment.
1. Code Review: When you are finished with this activity, pair up with a classmate and review each otherâ€™s code to make sure it meets all the requirements. 
1. Reflection: At the end of PLAN.md write a one paragraph reflection describing your experience with this activity. What went well? What was challenging? How could you improve your plan prior to beginning to code? Also include the name of your code review partner AND something interesting you found in their code. 

## Finally
1. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that Activity 1.2 is complete.
2. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.

# Markdown Resources
Markdown is a notation that is used to format text documents.  It is widely used in Software Development shops around the world, which is why we're asking you to use it in your lab documentation.  

Github provides a guide for getting started:  [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
